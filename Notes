User Authentication using Spring Security:

Add Spring Security dependencies to your project.

Create a User entity and implement a UserDetailsService to load user details from the database.

Configure security settings in a SecurityConfig class, specifying endpoints that require authentication.

Wishlist Management - RESTful API Endpoints:

Create a WishlistItem entity representing a wishlist item.

Implement a WishlistController with the following endpoints:

GET /api/wishlists: Retrieve a user's wishlist.

POST /api/wishlists: Create a new wishlist item.

DELETE /api/wishlists/{id}: Remove a wishlist item by ID.

Secure these endpoints to only allow authenticated users.

Database Integration using Spring Data JPA:

Design a database schema with tables for User and WishlistItem. Establish a relationship between them.

Implement repository interfaces for CRUD operations on wishlist entities.

Configure the application properties to connect to your chosen database.

Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories.

Use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing.

Aim for adequate test coverage to ensure the reliability of the application.

Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on setting up and running the application locally.

Include instructions for database setup and migration (if applicable).

Document how to run unit tests and any additional considerations for deployment.
